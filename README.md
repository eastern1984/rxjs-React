EXERCISE:
A live analytics dashboard displays data about a medical operating room to doctors and nurses. 
It receives its data from three independent monitoring systems:
Temperature
Air pressure
Humidity

Each system sends randomly data every 100-2000ms.
TASK:
Write an observable that, when subscribed to, emits a “display object” containing the latest value of all three systems, 
to be consumed by the dashboard.
REQUIREMENTS:
Display object should not be emitted more often than every 100ms
Display object should only be emitted when one of the systems sends a new value
If a value is not received from a specific system for more than 1000ms, 
its reading (in the display object) should be ‘N/A’

All 3 systems must emit at least one value before 1 display object is ever sent to the dashboard.

For the purposes of this exercise, assume that the readings from each system are available as a ‘data’ 
event on a node EventEmitter. For example:
temperature = new EventEmitter();
temperature.on(‘data’, data => { // data = ‘24.2’ })
DELIVERABLES:
provide a basic UI in react
all your RX business logic must be inside a UNIQUE observable
provide unit tests and basic component tests
share a github repo with your code
this coding exercise can be completed in 2-3 hours.
Nota Bene: you do not need to implement a backend. 
You can emulate the random data straight inside you React application by using an EventEmitter or other RXJS syntax.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
